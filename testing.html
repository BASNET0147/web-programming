<h2> ABOUT </h2>

<p>In 1742 Prithvi Nārāyaṇ became king of Gurkha. An ambitious ruler, he was able to quickly<br/>
 enlarge his <u>territory by conquering the quarrelsome and disunited principalities around Gurkha</u>.<br/>
 Prithvi Nārāyaṇ’s initial attempts to establish hegemony over the three Malla kingdoms were abortive,<br/>
 however; the raja of Kāthmāndu enlisted the aid of the East India Company in 1767 and was able to<br/>
 repulse Prithvi Nārāyaṇ’s encroachments. <s>Two years later</s>, however, after the company’s forces<br/>
 had been recalled, Kāthmāndu was taken. This allowed Prithvi Nārāyaṇ to <q>consolidate his territories<br/>
 into a new Kingdom of Nepal,</q> which he made into a unified, strong, and independent state.
